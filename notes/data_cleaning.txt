data_cleaning.py â€“ Text Preprocessing Module

The implemented operations include:

1. Removing Extra Whitespace
   Code: " ".join(text.split())
   Purpose: Normalize spacing by converting multiple spaces into a single space.
   Explanation: Enhances consistency in tokenization and ensures that spacing irregularities do not affect analysis or model performance.

2. Lowercasing
   Code: text.lower()
   Purpose: Convert all characters to lowercase.
   Explanation: Standardizes the text and prevents case-sensitive mismatches during tokenization or vectorization (e.g., "Apple" vs. "apple").

3. Removing Punctuation
   Code: text.translate(str.maketrans("", "", string.punctuation))
   Purpose: Eliminate all punctuation marks.
   Explanation: Punctuation is generally not meaningful in most NLP models unless explicitly modeled (e.g., in sentiment analysis or syntactic parsing).

4. Removing Special Characters
   Code: re.sub(r"[A-Za-z0-9\s]", "", text)
   Purpose: Strip non-alphanumeric characters and symbols.
   Explanation: Retains only letters, numbers, and whitespace to reduce input complexity.

5. Correcting Spelling Errors
   Code: TextBlob(text).correct()
   Purpose: Automatically fix typographical errors in text.
   Explanation: TextBlob uses probabilistic models to suggest corrections, increasing the quality and interpretability of the text.

6. Removing HTML Tags
   Code: BeautifulSoup(html_text, "html.parser").get_text()
   Purpose: Extract pure text from HTML content.
   Explanation: Useful in web scraping scenarios to clean raw HTML and isolate meaningful content.
