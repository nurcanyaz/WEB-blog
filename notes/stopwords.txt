stopwords.py ‚Äì Stopword Removal Module 

Stopwords are very common words in a language (such as ‚Äúthe‚Äù, ‚Äúis‚Äù, ‚Äúare‚Äù, ‚Äúfrom‚Äù)
that typically carry little semantic weight. Removing them helps clean the data,
reduce noise, and improve the performance of machine learning and NLP models.

1. Loading the Stopword List
--------------------------------------------------

Code:
```python
from nltk.corpus import stopwords
import nltk
nltk.download("stopwords")

stop_words = set(stopwords.words("english"))

üîç Explanation:

This code imports the English stopwords from the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library.

stop_words becomes a Python set containing hundreds of English stopwords.

Using a set improves performance when checking membership (O(1) time complexity).

üéØ Why It Matters:

NLP models work best when they focus on meaningful content. Stopwords often dilute that focus.

Removing them improves feature quality in tasks such as classification, sentiment analysis, or keyword extraction.

Filtering Stopwords from a Text

filtered_words = [word for word in text_list if word.lower() not in stop_words]

üîç Explanation:

text_list is a list of tokenized words (usually from a sentence or document).

The code converts each word to lowercase (to match the stopwords list) and filters out any stopword.

The result is a list (filtered_words) that includes only the informative, non-stopword words.

Stopword lists are available in many other languages, e.g., stopwords.words("turkish").

For domain-specific tasks, it's often useful to create a custom stopword list to remove irrelevant words

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:

Be sure to install the NLTK package using pip install nltk if it's not already installed.

The line nltk.download("stopwords") is only needed once to fetch the stopwords dataset.
